-Driving Instructions (Controls)
						
Control					  ORBIT (Project 1)					  | Ground (Project 2)
Left-Click + Drag     	- Pan Camera 							- Spin and Tile camera in first person (ground)
Right-Click + Drag    	- Rotate Camera							- Spin and Tile camera in first person (ground)
Scroll in/out			- Zoom in/out

Move Mouse 				- N/A									- Spin and Tilt camera when in passive mode (Added), Needs mouse capture to be good, disabled by default

c 						- Switch P1/P2							- Switch P1/P2
p						- N/A 									- Toogle passive (capture) mouse, will have to click+drag if this is turned off. This mode needs a bit more work, kinda wanky at the moment w/o mouse capture

w						- N/A 									- When in Project 2 naviation Mode, this will move the player forward
s						- N/A 									- When in Project 2 naviation Mode, this will move the player backward
a						- N/A 									- When in Project 2 naviation Mode, this will move the player left
d						- N/A 									- When in Project 2 naviation Mode, this will move the player rigth


-Misc Notes


- Project 2 --------------------------------------------------

Added DigitalState enum, for button states for W,A,S,D. and C
This makes it easy to see if any button on the keyboard has been
pressed, released, down, or up. This code is actually mostly
on the scene b/c of project structure. I may change this in the future
for greater clarity.




- Project 1 --------------------------------------------------
I also added a number of varaibles to the scene class for our camera
parameters such as cameraTilt, cameraSpin, cameraZoom, etc...

I got board on the first part of the project and decided to try and
put in SSE instructions for the matrix mulitply. I was able to get
this working on my machine but have #ifdef them out in case your
test platform's environment doesn't have <xmmintrin.h> for the 
include of SSE primatives... There is of course the normal code below it...
