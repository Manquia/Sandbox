Project 1

-Driving Instructions (Controls)

Left-Click + Drag     	- Pan Camera
Right-Click + Drag    	- Rotate Camera
Scroll in/out			- Zoom in/out

-Misc

Added DigitalState enum, which I ended up not using on P1 but will
probably use for P2 to ensure button states for W,A,S,D.

I also added a number of varaibles to the scene class for our camera
parameters such as cameraTilt, cameraSpin, cameraZoom, etc...

I got board on the first part of the project and decided to try and
put in SSE instructions for the matrix mulitply. I was able to get
this working on my machine but have #ifdef them out in case your
test platform's environment doesn't have <xmmintrin.h> for the 
include of SSE primatives... There is of course the normal code below it...
