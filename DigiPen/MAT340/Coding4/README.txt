MAT340-S18 Coding #3
Micah Rust

Just open the .exe file and click on the
buttons. Press escape to leave any of the
problems. Feel free to use windowed mode
to help with grading as most resolutions should
work just fine.

Note: Problem 3, the data is baked into the program.
The question makes no meantion of input from the excel sheet so I just baked it into the code,
Problem 3 is still on the list to run the calcuations but it won't take any input from other files.
